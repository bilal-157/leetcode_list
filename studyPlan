# ✅ **Where to Start Again (Recommended Path)**

You already solved all these before, but after a break, your brain needs a warm-up. So follow this sequence:

---

# **1️⃣ Warm-up (5–7 days) — Rebuild Foundations**

These types refresh your intuition quickly:

### **Array + Hashing (Very Important)**

Start here again because they build your confidence.

Do these problems **again**:

* Contains Duplicate
* Missing Number
* Single Number
* Two Sum
* Squares of a Sorted Array
* Minimum Absolute Difference
* Contains Duplicate II

These take 1–2 days of practice, maximum.

---

# **2️⃣ Sliding Window (5–7 days)**

This is VERY important for interviews.

Do:

* Minimum Size Subarray Sum
* Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
* 3Sum (two-pointer + sorting logic refresher)

Practice 2–3 sliding window problems daily.

---

# **3️⃣ DFS/BFS (Islands, Graph Basics)**

To re-memorize patterns:

* Number of Islands
* Spiral Matrix (matrix traversal)

Spend **2 days** here.

---

# **4️⃣ Recursion + Backtracking**

You solved:

* Subsets
* Letter Case Permutation

Do these again slowly to re-remember patterns:

* Subsets
* Permutations
* Letter Case Permutation

---

# **5️⃣ Dynamic Programming (High value)**

Restart with basics:

* Climbing Stairs
* Coin Change
* Counting Bits

Once these feel easy → move to harder DP.

---

# **6️⃣ Trees**

* Convert Sorted Array to BST
  (Then add tree traversal problems.)

---

# 🎯 What to Do Long-Term (1-hour daily routine)

### **Daily plan (for 2 hours/day like you said earlier):**

1. **30 min** – Solve 1 old problem again
2. **1 hour** – Solve new problem from same category
3. **30 min** – Watch explanation or revise pattern

---

# 🚀 After 2–3 weeks, move to these topics:

* Prefix sum
* Monotonic stack
* Binary search on answer
* Graphs (medium level)
* DP medium level

---

# 📌 Your Next Steps (Simple)

Here’s exactly what to do next:

### **Day 1–2**

Solve these again:

* Contains Duplicate
* Missing Number
* Single Number
* Two Sum

### **Day 3–4**

* Best Time to Buy Sell Stock
* Minimum Size Subarray Sum

### **Day 5**

* 3Sum

Then move on gradually.
